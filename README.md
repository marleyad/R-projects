## Projects

### 1. **ShoeFly.com A/B Test Analysis**
Conducted an A/B test to compare the performance of two ads across various platforms and days of the week. The analysis revealed that the effectiveness of the ads varied depending on the platform and day, with one ad outperforming the other overall. Based on the results, it is recommended that ShoeFly.com adopt the more effective ad, particularly on specific days of the week.

**Key Insights:** The ad performance differed significantly by platform and day, influencing the overall effectiveness.  
**Conclusion:** The recommended ad should be used strategically to maximize click-through rates.

### 2. **Familiar's Blood Transfusion Analysis**
Using R and hypothesis testing, analyzed blood transfusion data to support decision-making at Familiar. The analysis involved calculating standard deviation, performing t-tests, and evaluating p-values to assess the significance of differences in lifespans between users of Familiar's Vein Pack and Artery Pack products. The findings provided evidence-based recommendations on the impact of these products on subscriber longevity.

**Key Insights:** Significant lifespan differences were identified between the two products, informing product strategy.  
**Conclusion:** The analysis supports data-driven decisions on product offerings.

### 3. **NYC Real Estate Cost Analysis**
Analyzed the costs of one-bedroom apartments in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens using Streeteasy.com data. The project focused on calculating the mean, median, and mode costs to draw comparisons across boroughs, revealing substantial cost-of-living differences. The analysis included considerations of data assumptions and potential histogram shapes for price distributions.

**Key Insights:** Manhattan's apartment costs are significantly higher than Brooklyn's and Queens', reflecting the premium on central locations.  
**Conclusion:** The analysis highlights the importance of considering location in real estate investment decisions.

### 4. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
Utilized R to import raw data, remove unnecessary symbols, and reformat columns to ensure data types were correct. Duplicates were removed, resulting in a clean and consolidated data frame ready for analysis. This project underscores the importance of data preparation in obtaining reliable and actionable insights.

**Key Insights:** Effective data cleaning is critical to the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analyses.  
**Conclusion:** Clean and well-prepared data is foundational for any analytical project.

### 5. **Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis**
Investigated the relationship between economic success and longevity by analyzing life expectancy and GDP data across 158 countries. The project involved calculating quartiles and visualizing distributions using histograms. By splitting the data into low and high GDP groups, the analysis compared life expectancy quartiles to assess correlations between wealth and lifespan.

**Key Insights:** Countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancy, though outliers exist.  
**Conclusion:** Economic factors significantly impact longevity, but other variables must also be considered.

### 6. **Race Day Analysis and Management**
Developed an R script to manage race day information for friends, including jersey colors, participant details, and race placements. The script featured a custom function, `find_place()`, to determine finishing positions and effectively handle cases for both known and unknown participants. The project demonstrated the use of loops and apply functions for efficient data processing.

**Key Insights:** Automation through custom functions simplifies the management of event-specific data.  
**Conclusion:** The script enhances race day organization and provides quick access to critical information.

### 7. **London Weather Data Analysis**
Analyzed a 2015 dataset containing over 39,000 weather data points from London to determine the best time to visit based on temperature trends. The project calculated mean, variance, and standard deviation for temperature across different months and extended the analysis to other weather attributes such as humidity and air pressure. This comprehensive overview provided actionable insights for travel planning.

**Key Insights:** Optimal travel periods can be identified by analyzing temperature trends alongside other weather factors.  
**Conclusion:** The analysis informs data-driven decisions for planning travel to London.

### 8. **Historical CO2 Levels Visualization**
Visualized historical carbon dioxide levels using datasets spanning 8,000 and 2,000 years. The project employed R to create line graphs that highlight key trends, including the recent spike in CO2 levels compared to historical averages. Horizontal lines were integrated into the visualizations to mark historical peaks, providing clarity on the changes in CO2 concentrations over time.

**Key Insights:** Recent CO2 levels far exceed historical norms, underscoring the urgency of addressing climate change.  
**Conclusion:** The visualization effectively communicates the alarming rise in CO2 levels, supporting environmental awareness efforts.
